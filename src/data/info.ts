  jobDescription: "iOS Developer",
  about: `I'm an iOS developer based in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. I am passionate about merging the worlds of medicine and technology, crafting applications that enhance research and healthcare. With a rich experience in bilingual technical support and as a freelance developer, I have developed robust skills in both iOS development and full-stack web development.

  Over my career, I have accumulated expertise in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, and various backend technologies, successfully leading projects for platforms like Expedia and healthcare applications. Continuously seeking to expand my knowledge, I've also delved into Python, Firebase, and machine learning frameworks, which complement my extensive work with databases and server management on cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, and AWS.
